Great to hear it's working.

## What we fixed

1. Environment variables — created `.env.systemd` with database credentials
2. Missing API key — added `DATAJUD_API_KEY` to environment
3. Nginx configuration — fixed proxy to connect to Gunicorn
4. Database migrations — created all required tables manually
5. User creation — created login user with proper `tenant_id`
6. Multi-tenant setup — configured `MULTI_TENANT` and `DEFAULT_TENANT_ID`
